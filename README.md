# Android Agentic Template

This is a GitHub repository template for Android projects, designed following the **Agentic Engineering** methodology for autonomous AI agent development.

## Project Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: Instruction layer for the AI agent developer.
- `SOUL.md`: Persona and core truths for the agent.
- `IDENTITY.md`: Agent's name and vibe.
- `MEMORY.md`: Long-term project memory.
- `GATE.md`: The Project Gate documentation.
- `gate.sh`: Script for verifying changes before commit.
- `app/`: Minimal Android application structure.

## Agentic Engineering Methodology

1. **Instruction Layer**: Guides the agent's behavior and ensures alignment.
2. **Atomic Commits**: Encourages small, logical steps.
3. **The Gate**: Automates verification for code quality and correctness.
4. **Closing the Loop**: Agents are empowered to fix issues found by the Gate.
5. **No Plan Mode**: Agile development focused on immediate next steps.

## Quick Start

1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Give your AI agent access to the repo.
3. The agent will read `AGENTS.md` and start driving the project!
