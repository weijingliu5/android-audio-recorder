        summary="Missing ABI Support for ChromeOS"
        explanation="To properly support ChromeOS, your Android application should have an x86 and/or x86_64 binary as part of the build configuration. To fix the issue, ensure your files are properly optimized for ARM; the binary translator will then ensure compatibility with x86. Alternatively, add an `abiSplit` for x86 within your `build.gradle` file and create the required x86 dependencies."
